title: "COSMIC: Generalized Refusal Direction Identification in LLM Activations"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-cosmic
excerpt: 'COSMIC presents a novel approach to understanding and identifying refusal mechanisms in large language models by analyzing activation patterns. The work develops methods for detecting generalized refusal directions within model activations, providing insights into how language models implement safety mechanisms and refuse inappropriate requests. This research contributes to both interpretability and safety in LLM development.'
